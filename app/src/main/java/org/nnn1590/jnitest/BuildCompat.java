		 * {@link android.content.res.Configuration#screenWidthDp},
		 * {@link android.content.res.Configuration#screenHeightDp}, and

		 * new changes in behavior:</p>
		 * <ul>
		 * <li> For devices without a dedicated menu key, the software compatibility
		 * menu key will not be shown even on phones.  By targeting Ice Cream Sandwich
		 * or later, your UI must always have its own menu UI affordance if needed,
		 * on both tablets and phones.  The ActionBar will take care of this for you.
		 * <li> 2d drawing hardware acceleration is now turned on by default.
		 * You can use
		 * {@link android.R.attr#hardwareAccelerated android:hardwareAccelerated}
		 * to turn it off if needed, although this is strongly discouraged since
		 * it will result in poor performance on larger screen devices.
		 * <li> The default theme for applications is now the "device default" theme:
		 *      {@link android.R.style#Theme_DeviceDefault}. This may be the
		 *      holo dark theme or a different dark theme defined by the specific device.
		 *      The {@link android.R.style#Theme_Holo} family must not be modified
		 *      for a device to be considered compatible. Applications that explicitly
		 *      request a theme from the Holo family will be guaranteed that these themes
		 *      will not change character within the same platform version. Applications
		 *      that wish to blend in with the device should use a theme from the
		 *      {@link android.R.style#Theme_DeviceDefault} family.
		 * <li> Managed cursors can now throw an exception if you directly close
		 * the cursor yourself without stopping the management of it; previously failures
		 * would be silently ignored.
		 * <li> The fadingEdge attribute on views will be ignored (fading edges is no
		 * longer a standard part of the UI).  A new requiresFadingEdge attribute allows
		 * applications to still force fading edges on for special cases.
		 * <li> {@link android.content.Context#bindService Context.bindService()}
		 * will not automatically add in {@link android.content.Context#BIND_WAIVE_PRIORITY}.
		 * <li> App Widgets will have standard padding automatically added around
		 * them, rather than relying on the padding being baked into the widget itself.
		 * <li> An exception will be thrown if you try to change the type of a
		 * window after it has been added to the window manager.  Previously this
		 * would result in random incorrect behavior.
		 * <li> {@link android.view.animation.AnimationSet} will parse out
		 * the duration, fillBefore, fillAfter, repeatMode, and startOffset
		 * XML attributes that are defined.
		 * <li> {@link android.app.ActionBar#setHomeButtonEnabled
		 * ActionBar.setHomeButtonEnabled()} is false by default.

		 * <li>{@link android.R.attr#focusable} defaults to a new state ({@code auto}) where it will
		 * inherit the value of {@link android.R.attr#clickable} unless explicitly overridden.</li>
